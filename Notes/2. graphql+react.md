## 0. Dependencies

1. ApolloCient
2. ApolloProvider
3. graphql-tag ([gql](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag#graphql-tag)): a helper that allow us to write queries inside of a component.
4. react-apollo ([graphql](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo#usage)): a glue layer between React and apollo data source.

## 1. App Structure

In between our React application and GraphQL server are two important piece of technology: Apollo Provider and Apollo Store.

**Apollo Store** is what is going to communicate directly with the GraphQL server and store data that comes back from it locally, so we can think of Appollo store as a store of data that exists on the **client side** of our application. Appollo store doesn't care what framework we're using to show the data on screen (React or whatsoever).

The intergration layer between the Apollo store and our React application is **Apollo Provider**. It will take data from the store and inject it into the React application, so it's the glue layer between the Apollo store and the actual React application. So the vast majority of configuration we're going to do is around the Apollo provider.

## 2. GraphQL + React Strategy

1. Identify data required (don't overfetch)
2. Write query in GraphiQL (for practice) and in component file
3. Bond query + component
4. Access data
