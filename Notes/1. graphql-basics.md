## 1. Problem with REST-ful Routing

REST, short for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer (可重新表达的状态迁移), is a style of software architecture. It relies on a **stateless, client-server** protocol, almost always HTTP. Four most frequently used HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Endpoints are the URI/URL a HTTP request is sent to. **REST-ful** is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture.

REST-ful Routing: Given a collection of records on a server, there should be a uniform URL and HTTP request method used to utilize that collection of records. And REST-ful routing with highly reational data starts to get quite challenging.

- Deciding on a url schema gets tough when we start to have heavily nested relationships.
- When fetching heavily nested data, we can easily run into situations where we make too many HTTP requests to get the data we need.
- We're vulnerable to over fetching data where we fetch an entire company when maybe we really need the name property of the company.

The issues can be solved but takes engineering time. And this is where GraphQL comes in. GraphQL wants to fix some real big inconsistencies or challenges around REST-ful routing and also tackle big issue around over serving data in a very timely fashion.

## 2. What is GraphQL

GraphQL considers all the data in our application to look like a graph.

## 3. GraphQL with Express

## 4. GraphQL Schema and Root Query

Schema file tells GraphQL exactly what our data looks like, e.g. what properties each object has and exactly how each object is related to each other. The best way to think about schema is as a bunch of functions that **return references to other objects (piece of data)** in the graph, so we can think of each of the edges in the graph as being a reslove function.

Root query is an entry point into our data.

## 5. Query Fragments

Example:

```javascript
fragment companyDetails on Company {
  id
  name
  description
}

// Query:
{
  apple: company(id: "1") {
    ...companyDetails
  }
  google: company(id: "2") {
    ...companyDetails
  }
}
```

## 6. Mutations

Example:

```javascript
const mutation = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  fields: {
    addUser: {
      // type: refer to the data that returned from the resolve function.
      // Sometime when we have a mutation, the collection of data we're
      // operationg on and the returned type might not always be the same.
      type: UserType,
      // args: some arguments or data that going to be passed into the
      // resolve function.
      args: {
        firstName: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
        age: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLInt) },
        companyId:  { type: GraphQLString }
      },
      resolve(parentValue, { firstName, age }) {
        return axios.post('http://localhost:3000/users', { firstName, age })
          .then(res => res.data);
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## 7. GraphQL Client

The React application we build is going to be very titely coupled with a GraphQL client. The purpose of GraphQL clients is to make a request to the GraphQL server, get the response back and forward it onto the React application. So we should think the GraphQL client as bonding layer between React and GraphQL server.

And the GraphQL query in between is to describe the relation between the GraphQL client and GraphQL server, they're very loosely coupled.

## 8. Three JavaScript GraphQL Clients (In Browser)

## 9. GraphQL Express vs Apollo Server

<img width="396" alt="graphql-express-apollo-server" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20265633/39157156-9512d732-4727-11e8-97e1-2959ccb6b981.PNG">

Why choose GraphQL Express instead of Apollo Server:

1. Apollo server changes a lot
2. Personal prefer colocating type properties with the resolve functions

## 10. Query Variables

Query variables are used to inject some variable from outside the query into the query. They're most frequently used with **mutations**, and also used with queries when we want to have a React component to **customize the query**, which is extremely helpful when it comes to filtering or pagination(分页), etc.

<img width="395" alt="query-variables" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20265633/39225825-969824ae-481c-11e8-90ff-9bba89d47b8c.PNG">

## 11. Cold/Warm Cache

<img width="402" alt="cold-warm-cache" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20265633/39263871-6adaebce-4891-11e8-987f-77a623c7dd02.PNG">

The "warm cache" is a very common problem throughout the Apollo world. When we insert a new record into the list, we need to manually tell Apollo to re-run the query that fetches the updated list after the mutation has beed executed.

Depends on how the query is associated with the component, there are two solutions:

When the query we want to refetch was not associated with the component (songCreate):

```javascript
onSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  this.props.mutate({
    variables: { title: this.state.title },
    refetchQueries: [{ query }]    // use `refetchQueries`
  }).then(() => hashHistory.push('/'));
}
```

When the component did received the query inside the `props` object: (`refetchQueries` works too)

```javascript
onSongDelete(id) {
  this.props.mutate({ variables: { id } })
    .then(() => this.props.data.refetch());    // use `this.props.data.refetch()`
}
```
