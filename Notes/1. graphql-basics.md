1. Problem with REST-ful Routing

REST, short for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer (可重新表达的状态迁移), is a style of software architecture. It relies on a **stateless, client-server** protocol, almost always HTTP. Four most frequently used HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Endpoints are the URI/URL a HTTP request is sent to. **REST-ful** is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture.

REST-ful Routing: Given a collection of records on a server, there should be a uniform URL and HTTP request method used to utilize that collection of records. And REST-ful routing with highly reational data starts to get quite challenging.

- Deciding on a url schema gets tough when we start to have heavily nested relationships.
- When fetching heavily nested data, we can easily run into situations where we make too many HTTP requests to get the data we need.
- We're vulnerable to over fetching data where we fetch an entire company when maybe we really need the name property of the company.

The issues can be solved but takes engineering time. And this is where GraphQL comes in. GraphQL wants to fix some real big inconsistencies or challenges around REST-ful routing and also tackle big issue around over serving data in a very timely fashion.

2. What is GraphQL

GraphQL considers all the data in our application to look like a graph.

3. GraphQL with Express

4. GraphQL Schema

Schema file tells GraphQL exactly what our data looks like, e.g. what properties each object has and exactly how each object is related to each other.

5. Root Query

An entry point into our data.
